## General info
Dear WheelRight Team,
I hope you had a great week! I had fun diving back into Redux with this challenge.
It was a pleasure to create this app. Main goal for me was to create
this app that is easy to maintain, easy to add future discounts and easy to connect to API.
I used Redux instead [useContext](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), because
I feel more confident with it.


My apologies for the delay, but I helped my girlfriend with Settled Status and NIN.
I spent about three days with it, because I want to be 100% sure it works,
it is fast, and it is pretty and of course it works :)

Iâ€™m looking forward to hearing from you!
